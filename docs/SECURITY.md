# Security Information

This program does not store or save any information, and as far as I know it doesn't let you escalate privileges. So the most pressing security issue is to keep keys, passwords and other sensitive information hidden from the github. This is done by setting up default config files (so you know how they look like) and having custom ones with information attuned to me.

However, if you find some security issue, feel free to let me know and I'll get right on it!
